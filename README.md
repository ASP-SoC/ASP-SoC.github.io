Project Audio Signal Processing - System on Chip

# Abstract

The aim of this project is to creat a universal standalone customizable audio signal processing chain on a FPGA SoC.

The audio processing is realized in hardware and the configuration/visualisation interface is based on a Linux OS on the ARM Core. The software is based on a webpage which is hosted on the system, so you easily can access it in your home network. You can use it with any device with a webbrowser, such as your PC, Smartphone or Laptop. 

The platform is fully configurable, so you simply can add new components/blocks to the processing chain.

Planned blocks are:

*Equalizer
*Audio Effects
*Generic Filters
*Spectral Analysis
